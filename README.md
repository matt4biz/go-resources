# Go resources

This is a list of books, articles, videos, and other resources about learning Go along with some related topics. The apple &#x1F34E; marks items of particular note.

You can find **my online Go class** at this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoILbKo9rG3skRCj37Kn5Zj803hhiuRK6); subscribe to the channel for updates!

Although a few tools or frameworks are mentioned, this site is particularly oriented towards tutorials or articles to improve one's knowledge of Go or software development, particularly development for the cloud.

If you're looking for links to software, [Awesome Go](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go/) is a site primarily oriented toward Go projects with some information on conventions and tutorials also. Also, see [this repo](https://github.com/tmrts/go-patterns) for Go patterns, recipes, and idioms.

Inanc Gumus has [a repo](https://github.com/inancgumus/learngo) of exercises from his class that you should check out.
